# Token Data sets
## 1. networkbnbTX.txt (Token edge Data)
Token edge files have this row structure: fromNodeID\ttoNodeID\tunixTime\ttokenAmount\r\n
This row implies that fromNodeID sold tokenAmount of the token to toNodeID at time unixTime. 
fromNodeID and toNodeID are people who invest in the token in real life; 
each investor can also use multiple addresses. Two addresses can sell/buy tokens multiple times with multiple amounts. 
For this reason, the network is considered a weighted, directed multi(edge) graph. 
Each token has a maximum token count maxt; you can think of maxt as the total circulating token amount.

## 2. binance.txt (Price Data)
Price files have this row structure: Date\tOpen\tHigh\tLow\tClose\tVolume\tMarketCap\r
The price data is taken from https://coinmarketcap.com/. Open and close are the prices of the specific token at the given date. 
Volume and MarketCap give total bought/sold tokens and market valuation at the date.

## Token supply and sub-unit definitions
Token has a limited supply (i.e., token count, which can be found on coinmarketcap.com as circulating amount). Then each token may have sub-units. This idea comes from Bitcoin where subunits are called Satoshis, 1 Bitcoin =108 satoshis. Coin market cap gives the total supply, but not sub-units, which differ from token to token. Some tokens have 1018 sub-units. That means there can be numbers as big as totalAmountâˆ—1018.
